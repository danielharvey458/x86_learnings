# x86_learnings
Selected code snippets from trying to learn x86 assembler.

These exercises primarily come from 'Introduction to 64 Bit Assembly Programming for Linux and OS X'.

Most of the code is barely complete, and missing a lot of important features such as error handling,
and is no doubt ridden with bugs too.

There are better solutions available from other GitHubbers.
